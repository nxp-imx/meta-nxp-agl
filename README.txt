This builds the Wayland-Weston AGL image with the basic AGL interface. 
Demos can then be run on top of this.

This image has only been run on i.MX 6QP Sabre and Sabre Auto.
It is not supported nor tested.  It is simply a demo showing that the basic image runs.
It runs on the 4.1.15-1.0.0 Freescale release of Linux.

The CES2016 demo is in this image.  To run it, you need to connect an HDMI monitor in the "portrait" orientation.
The dimensions in the demos are hard coded.  The files used are in /opt/AGL/CES2016 and /etc/xdg/weston.
