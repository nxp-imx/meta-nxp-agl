This builds the Wayland-Weston AGL image with the basic AGL interface
using the NXP i.MX BSP layers in https://github.com/nxp-imx/meta-imx.
Demos can then be run on top of this.
The i.MX 8QuadMax and 8QuadXPlus Multisensory Environment Kits are
supported.

This image is not supported nor tested.
It's simply a demo showing that the basic image runs.
It runs on the i.MX Linux release indicated by the repo manifest name.
